### Taylor_Pregranulosa_Cells
In repository file we present a cESFW feature selection workflow to obtain a set of top ranked genes for the pre-granulosa activation single cell RNA sequencing dataset produced by [Taylor et al](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.24.513438v2). 

## cESFW software package
The continuous entropy sort feature weighting (cESFW) software may be downloaded and installed from [https://github.com/aradley/cESFW](https://github.com/aradley/cESFW), and was origionally presented in [Branching topology of the human embryo transcriptome revealed by entropy sort feature weighting](https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/151/11/dev202832/352632/Branching-topology-of-the-human-embryo).
